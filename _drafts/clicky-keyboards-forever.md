title: The Legend of the Clicky Keyboard
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Last year I did a co-op at a company in Minneapolis called [Digi
International][digi]. During the summer there were 11 Software Engineers all
working in one big cubicle that we dubbed "The Supercube." One of the most
defining characteristics of this cubicle was the noise of all of us typing.

## The Legend

Most of us just used the standard keyboards we were given but four of the
interns had "clicky keyboards". Clicky keyboards are named (obviously)
for the sound they make when one types on them.

## Types (better name here)

Each of the clicky keyboards was different. The most impressive was a completely
working [IBM Model M][modelm] which was named "The Kremlin" by my Russian
friend. It was the first time I had heard about the keyboard but I understood
the love for it the instant I tried typing on it.

Another one of my coworkers had a [Das Keyboard][das] which is by far the most
intimidating of the keyboards. Some models of the Das Keyboards come
without lettering on the keys.

The third type of clicky keyboard that was used was a [Razer Blackwidow
Ultimate][razer]. It was by far the most visually pleasing of the keyboards.

## Legend Continues

I had wanted to buy one while I was there, but I just couldn't justify spending
the money for one. Instead I promised myself that one day I would get a nice
clicky keyboard.
