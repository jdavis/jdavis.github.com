Paul Graham said it best in his excellent essay about how sometimes you have to
[Do Things that Don't Scale][ds]. Customer service is exactly one of those
things.

In the last 6 months, I've had three unique experiences with three different
companies.

## Experience \#1: Codility Experience

Near the end of the summer I began my job search for when I'd graduate in May. I
had a ton of interviews and various coding challenges.

After applying for one, I was given a link to an online programming challenge
using the website [Codility][codility]. It had two different problems and
neither were that challenging.

However, while working on the second problem, the code editor that Codility,
[CodeMirror][codemirror] used at the time started to act up.

Although I wasn't aware of what I did at the time, I accidentally highlighted
some text and performed a drag n' drop on it. This caused the editor to enter an
inconsistent state and the code disappeared and would flash shortly after any
keystroke.

These factors all together made the problem impossible to finish. I wrote a note
to the people reviewing my code that the editor was acting up. Then I reached
out to Codility to let them know what happened.

I included the details about what happened and a few suggestions that I had
regarding it.

Less than 24 hours later, I had a reply from one of the engineers confirming
that he was able to recreate the bug. He mentioned that they were delaying
updating to the latest version of CodeMirror (which fixed this bug) because it
had Internet Explorer compatibility issues.

He apologized for the inconvenience and thanked me for the email. He also said
that Codility would reach out to the company and let the recruiter know.

### Free T-shirt? Heck yes!

The same day I was contacted by another person at Codility. She also apologized
and said that they appreciated the bug report. She then went on to say that my
email "made our afternoon" and that they want to start a giveaway to customers
that report bugs that improve Codility. She asked if I'd like to be the first so
of course I agreed.

### Conclusion

Not only did I move onto a phone screen and then finally an onsite interview for
the company that I was originally applying for, I also had an amazingly pleasant
experience of interacting with some great people at a great company and also got
a free t-shirt.
