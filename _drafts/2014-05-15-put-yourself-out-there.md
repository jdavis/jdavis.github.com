title: Put Yourself Out There&#58; The Myth of the Genius Programmer
description:
    A year ago I decided to put myself out there and face my fear of being
    vulnerable by starting a blog.

================

Just barely over a month ago, I started my blog with my very [first
post][first]. In it, I talked about how I was afraid to put myself out there and
how I slowly overcame it.

In this post, I want to discuss how the past year has gone as well as some of
the amazing things that have happened. I have met some really great people and
I've changed how I think of things because of it.

## The Myth of the Genius Programmer

Before I jump into that, let's take a look at the myth I was believing. The
video below is one of my favorite talks. It caused a paradigm shift in my
thinking when I first watched it. I very much believed in the myth. I was lucky
in that I watched it the summer before I started college.

If you have time, I recommend watching it. If you don't just continue on and
I'll summarize it.

### The Myth Summarized

The gist of the video is that it is a myth that to create software, you need to
isolate yourself in a room and code a ton. Then when you emerge from your
asylum, your project and code is so incredible that you are forever enshrined in
the annals of Computer Programming and you are hailed as a genius.

Beyond the obvious implications it has for being a programmer, the myth extends
to other professions as well. The idea is that it is bad to seek help and to
show your insecurities. If you have to seek help, then you are obviously
incompetent which will be looked down upon by your peers.

### Rules of Engagement

Instead the speakers, [Brian Fitzpatrick][fitz] and [Ben
Collins-Sussman][sussman], discuss how software should be developed with other
people and with as open as communication as possible. These "geniuses" that can
do it alone are actually incredibly rare and often their stories are over
exaggerated. Code that is written should be reviewed often and by other
people; your mistakes, vulnerabilities, and inner self should be completely
exposed.

This is hard because it goes against human nature; it isn't normal to show your
vulnerabilities. They encourage the following:

1. Make yourself vulnerable.
2. Be open.
3. Communicate well.
4. Embrace criticism.

### The Takeaway

The ending of the video they share the secret in what often happens if you don't
believe in the myth. They say that if you follow the guidelines above:

> ...people will think you're a genius.

This was completely revolutionary to me. I understood it the second they
explained it in the video. I knew people that hid nothing and were vulnerable in
every way; I just hadn't realized that this was why I revered them as such.

## Overcoming the Myth

I detailed how I was able to gradually do this in my [first post][first].
Essentially I just started small until I realized that nothing bad had happened
yet.

This is the classic idea of [desensitization][desensitization]. After the fear
of being vulnerable and exposed went away, I never even gave it a second
thought.

### Little Steps

I started putting some things on GitHub like my dotfiles. I started to do more
interviews for internships.

I started to talk to people about what I didn't know in addition to what I did
know.

I let let people into the protective little bubble that I had created for myself
that I thought was for the best.

## Be Vulnerable

My favorite blog post that I've written in the past year is without a doubt the
post about my favorite quote from the movie Gattaca: [Never Save Anything for
the Swim Back. Ever][swim-back].

I had a new friend that came across that blog post and read it. He sent me
one of the best message that I've received. This is what he said:

> man, you are awesome :). just scanned over your personal website, and I was
> inspired and impressed with what you've done :). It makes me want to try
> harder to find and achieve what I really wanna do in my life. You are great
> Josh. I am glad I had a chance to meet you :)

He then stayed up past 2am watching Gattaca and loved it.

I wrote that blog post because it was something that I hold very near to the
core of who I am. I've drawn a lot of inspiration from the film over the years.
As such, it was something that only a few people knew.

By writing that, I made it known that I compare myself to other people a lot. I
told how I struggle with feelings of inferiority and fear of being "stupid".

Yet to have someone read about your vulnerabilities and draw inspiration from it
rather than to judge you is so incredibly meaningful & exquisite.

### A Tale of Many Tales

That is just one example but there have been many others. From people teaching
college classes that have stumbled upon my post about using GitHub for
university assignments, to people that are now using LaTeX for homework.

Helping an old lady cross the street with her groceries is a great feeling. But
the feeling of changing how someone's brain thinks and changing how someone
follows where their heart is leading them is far beyond great.

### Something here TODO

This past March I made a website called [TwoFactorAuth.org][tfa]. It was
something that I would never have done if I hadn't overcome the myth and had
still been afraid.

The idea would have entered my mind only to be met with an endless stream of
reasons why it wouldn't be perfect and how I'd look like a fool. The motivation
for doing it would be drowned in the torrent. I would go on my way looking for
the idea where I would be finally hailed as a "genius".
