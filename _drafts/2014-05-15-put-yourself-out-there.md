title: Put Yourself Out There
description:
    A year ago I decided to put myself out there and face my fear of being
    vulnerable by starting a blog.

================

One year and four days ago, I started my blog with my very [first post][first].
In it I mentioned that Nathan Marz's article on [Breaking into Silicon Valley
with a blog][marz] was a huge motivator for me.

In this post, I want to discuss how the past year has gone as well as some of
the amazing things that have happened. I was able to put aside my fears and have
met some really great people because of it.

## Vulnerability

My main concern in starting a blog was how internally revealing it is to others.
When visiting another person's blog you can read their writing, their thoughts,
their passions and fears. You can see a person's soul.
