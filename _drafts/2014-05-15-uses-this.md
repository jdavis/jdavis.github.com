    TODO.

I'm a big fan of [UsesThis.com][usesthis] and love reading about people that I
admire and how they work. It may seem a bit corny, but I want to do a UsesThis
of my own because I'm incredibly picky when it comes to what I use. Here goes.

# Josh Davis

## Who are you, and what do you do?

If I had written this a week ago, I'd have said that I'm a Computer Science
undergraduate major, but I just graduated this past Saturday with my Bachelors.

I will start working at Amazon on [AWS][aws] in exactly two months as a Software
Engineer on the Dev Productivity & Tools team.

## What hardware do you use?

I am a lover of Apple's hardware & software. I've only owned 2 different iMacs
starting with the first one that I bought in 2006. They are my favorite machine
to use as long as I have a nice [mechanical keyboard][das] and a
[Trackball][trackball].

When I'm not at home, I have a generic Dell laptop that used to run [Arch
Linux][arch] but now runs [Linux Mint][mint]. I can't wait to get rid of it to
get a [Macbook Air][air]. I love Linux but I get a bit tired of configuring it
endlessly to work exactly how I want.

## And what software?

I can't do any coding or text editing without [Vim][vim]. I love tweaking it to
work perfectly with my workflow. I'm pretty obsessed with productivity and
getting things done. I also have high hopes for [Neovim][neovim] and want to do
all I can to see it come to fruition.

I have a handful of Gmail accounts that I manage with [Mailplane][mailplane]. It
is a great way to manage multiple accounts.

The app that I use the most is probably [Chrome][chrome]. I probably waste too
much time looking at various things on the internet.

Lastly, as long as I have a terminal (either iTerm or Terminal.app) with
[tmux][tmux] installed, I can pretty much get by with these 4 apps and don't
have to install much else.

Of course at the command line I'd need Git, Homebrew, and various other tools
but those almost go without saying when it comes to being a software engineer
while using OS X.

## What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be finished as long as I had a Macbook Air. It would be the
perfect addition and allow me to work on things anywhere. Plus the size and
portability make it awesome.

I have just been holding off buying one because it isn't a necessity.
