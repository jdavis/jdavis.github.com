# {{ page.title }}

I'm a big fan of [UsesThis.com][usesthis] and love reading about people that I
admire and how they work. It may seem a bit corny, but I want to do a UsesThis
of my own because I'm incredibly picky when it comes to what I use. Here goes.

## Who are you, and what do you do?

If I had written this a week ago, I'd have said that I'm a Computer Science
undergraduate major, but I just graduated this past Saturday with my Bachelors.

I will start working at Amazon on [AWS][aws] in exactly two months as a Software
Engineer on the Dev Productivity & Tools team.

## What hardware do you use?

I am a lover of Apple's hardware & software. I've only owned 2 different iMacs
starting with the first one that I bought in 2006. They are my favorite machine
to use as long as I have a nice [mechanical keyboard][das] and a
[Trackball][trackball].

When I'm not at home, I have a generic Dell laptop that used to run [Arch
Linux][arch] but now runs [Linux Mint][mint]. I can't wait to get rid of it to
get a [Macbook Air][air]. I love Linux but I get a bit tired of [configuring
it][dotfiles] endlessly to work exactly how I want.

## And what software?

I can't do any coding or text editing without [Vim][vim]. I love [tweaking
it][vimrc] to work perfectly with my workflow. I'm pretty obsessed with
productivity and getting things done. I also have high hopes for
[Neovim][neovim] and want to do all I can to see it come to fruition.

I have a handful of Gmail accounts that I manage with [Mailplane][mailplane]. It
is a great way to manage multiple accounts.

The app that I use the most is probably [Chrome][chrome] for obvious reasons.

As long as I have a terminal (either iTerm or Terminal.app) with [tmux][tmux]
installed to [my liking][tmuxconf], I can pretty much get by with these four
apps and don't have to install much else.

On the command line, there are a few necessities like Git, Homebrew, LaTeX and
the like. With those, a software engineer can just about conquer anything.

## What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be finished as long as I had a Macbook Air. It would be the
perfect addition and allow me to work on things anywhere. Plus the size and
portability make it awesome.
