================

It is a common occurrence for other students to comment on my homework whenever
I turn it in for one of my classes.

<div class="gallery xlarge">
    <a href="/img/latex/latex1.png" rel="lightbox[latex]" title="Cover page">
        <img src="/img/latex/latex1.png" width="180">
        <span>Cover page</span>
    </a>

    <a href="/img/latex/latex2.png" rel="lightbox[latex]" title="Example problem 2">
        <img src="/img/latex/latex2.png" width="180">
        <span>Algorithm problems</span>
    </a>

    <a href="/img/latex/latex3.png" rel="lightbox[latex]" title="Example problem 3">
        <img src="/img/latex/latex3.png" width="180">
        <span>Complexity problems</span>
    </a>

    <a href="/img/latex/latex4.png" rel="lightbox[latex]" title="Example problem 4">

    </a>
</div>

If I didn't know how easy it was and the benefits that I get from typesetting my
homework, I'd probably ask as well.  However, I'd argue that using LaTeX to type
up homework has made me a far better student than when I used to handwrite my
homeworks.

And that is something that I care a lot about.

## The Benefits

I can summarize the benefits like so:

1. It can be kept in Source Control: Handwriting can't be stored in a version
   control system; once you erase something, it's gone.

2. You can see your homework materialize in front of you: Seeing the results and
   the equations in their complete LaTeX-glory is a very powerful way to see
   things.

3. Neatness: Although my [handwriting has improved][handwriting] quite a bit, I
   still find myself slipping back into a rushed, messy script from the past.
