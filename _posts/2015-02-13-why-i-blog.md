================

It has been four months since my last blog post. I haven't been any businer than
I have been in the past. I have just become a bit complacent with my blog. This
blog post is just a reminder to myself Why I Blog and why I should continue.

You probably won't find this as interesting because it is intended only for me.
If you continue reading, keep that in mind.

## Timeline

I wrote my [first blog post][first-post] back in May of 2013. I had a lot of
drive and discipline and wrote nearly every week up until August when things
started to spread out a bit.

This was expected as school had just started. After the New Years, I was able to
go on a nice run which lasted up until June.

Compared to my earlier posts, the span from January to June contains some of my
most linked to blog posts. The average quality of each blog post was also the
highest it had been. Even a year after I am still receiving tweets and emails
regarding them. I think this is because the topics I chose were interesting and
because I put a lot of time into them.

In July, I made a move across the country and started a new job. Since I
started, I've only had 3 blog posts.

## Why I Started

1. I started because I wanted to overcome my fear and [put myself out
   there][put-yourself].
2. I wanted to show case my self and abilities instead of hiding behind a
   curtain of anonymity.
3. I wanted to "write for myself" like [Dijkstra][dikjstra] decided to do to
   overcome his writer's block that he suffered from.

## Why I've Stopped

I can come up with a few different excuses as to why I haven't blogged as much
as I could.

### Excuse #1: I've been busy too busy (like with work).

This is a silly one because I still have plenty of time outside of work.  It
isn't like I'm working 18 hours a day. Once I come home, I have plenty of time
to do what I want at night. Most of the problem is that the time just disappears
into non-quantifiable areas; many of which are unproductive areas.

### Excuse #2: I don't know what to write about.

This is a funny one. I have a huge Trello board filled with ideas that I can
pick from (pictured below the text whited out for various reasons):

<div class="gallery medium">
    <a href="/img/why-blog/trello.png" rel="lightbox[trello]" title="Blogging board on Trello">
        <img src="/img/why-blog/trello.png" alt="Blogging board on Trello" >
        <span>One of my Trello boards dedicated to blogging ideas.</span>
    </a>
</div>

There definitely isn't a shortage of things to write about there.

### Excuse #3: There isn't much of a need anymore.

This is definitely the lamest of the excuses. The root is that I have a job now
and I'm not actively seeking new employment like I was when I was in collge (and
blogging the most).

This is bogus because the "need" should be intrinsically motivated instead of
externally. I should have a "need" to write to articulate my thoughts, to learn
new things, and to explore topics that I normally wouldn't.

## Why I Blog

Even though I haven't been as prolific as I could hope; I still get a steady
stream of emails regarding my blog posts.

Each of them is as humbling as the first. With emails from people saying that I
inspired them, or that they came across a blog post and they learned a lot, to
people just saying thanks for [twofactorauth.org][2fa.org].

Each time a new email comes through or I meet a person that has read my blog
since I've dropped off, I feel guilty.
