title: Put Yourself Out There&#58; The Myth of the Genius Programmer
description:
    A year ago I decided to put myself out there and face my fear of being
    vulnerable by starting a blog. I look at what has happened since then and
    how great of an experience it has been.

================

Just barely over a year ago, I started my blog with my very [first
post][first]. In it, I talked about how I was afraid to put myself out there and
how I slowly overcame it.

In this post, I want to discuss how the past year has gone as well as some of
the amazing things that have happened. I have met some really great people and
I've changed how I think of things because of it.

## The Myth of the Genius Programmer

Before I jump into that, let's take a look at the myth I was believing. The
video below is one of my favorite talks. It caused a paradigm shift in my
thinking when I first watched it. I very much believed in the myth. I was lucky
in that I watched it the summer before I started college.

If you have time, I recommend watching it. If you don't just continue on and
I'll summarize it.

### The Myth

The gist of the video is that it is a myth that to create software, you need to
isolate yourself in a room and code a ton. Then when you emerge from your
asylum, your project and code is so incredible that you are forever enshrined in
the annals of Computer Programming and you are hailed as a genius.

Beyond the obvious implications it has for being a programmer, the myth extends
to other professions as well. The idea is that it is bad to seek help and to
show your insecurities. If you have to seek help, then you are obviously
incompetent which will be looked down upon by your peers.

### New Guidelines

Instead the speakers, [Brian Fitzpatrick][fitz] and [Ben
Collins-Sussman][sussman], discuss how software should be developed with other
people and with as open as communication as possible. These "geniuses" that can
do it alone are actually incredibly rare and often their stories are over
exaggerated. Code that is written should be reviewed often and by other
people; your mistakes, vulnerabilities, and inner self should be completely
exposed.

This is hard because it goes against human nature; it isn't normal to show your
vulnerabilities. They encourage the following:

1. Make yourself vulnerable.
2. Be open.
3. Communicate well.
4. Embrace criticism.

### The Takeaway

The ending of the video they share the secret in what often happens if you don't
believe in the myth. They say that if you follow the guidelines above:

> ...people will think you're a genius.

This was completely revolutionary to me. I understood it the second they
explained it in the video. I knew people that hid nothing and were vulnerable in
every way; I just hadn't realized that this was why I revered them as such.

## Overcoming the Myth

I detailed how I was able to gradually do this in my [first post][first].
Essentially I just started small until I realized that nothing bad had happened
yet.

This is the classic idea of [desensitization][desensitization]. After the fear
of being vulnerable and exposed went away, I never even gave it a second
thought.

### Little Steps

I started putting some things on GitHub like my dotfiles. I started to do more
interviews for internships.

I started to talk to people about what I didn't know in addition to what I did
know.

I let people into the protective little bubble that I had created for myself
because I thought the bubble was for the best.

## Be Vulnerable

My favorite blog post that I've written in the past year is without a doubt the
post about my favorite quote from the movie Gattaca: [Never Save Anything for
the Swim Back. Ever][swim-back].

One of my friends, Kien Nguyen, came across that blog post and read it. He sent
me one of the best messages that I've received. This is what he said:

> man, you are awesome :). just scanned over your personal website, and I was
> inspired and impressed with what you've done :). It makes me want to try
> harder to find and achieve what I really wanna do in my life. You are great
> Josh. I am glad I had a chance to meet you :)

Kien then decided to stay up late and watched the entire movie of Gattaca. I
know this because after 2am, he sent me a message saying that he just finished
watching it.

I wrote that blog post because it was something that I hold very near to the
core of who I am. I've drawn a lot of inspiration from the film over the years.
As such, it was something that only a few people knew.

By writing that, I made it known that I compare myself to other people a lot. I
told how I struggle with feelings of inferiority and the fear of being "stupid".

Yet to have someone read about your vulnerabilities and draw inspiration from it
rather than to judge you is so incredibly meaningful & exquisite.

### A Tale of Many Tales

That is just one example but there have been many others. From people teaching
college classes that have stumbled upon my post about [using GitHub for
university assignments][github-college], to people that are now [using LaTeX for
homework][homework].

Changing someone's heart and their mind to want to become better and to learn
more is an incredible feeling.

### Open Source Opportunities

This past March I made a website called [TwoFactorAuth.org][tfa]. It was
something that I would never have done if I hadn't overcome the myth and had
still been afraid.

The idea would have entered my mind only to be met with an endless stream of
reasons why it wouldn't be perfect and how I'd look like a fool. The motivation
for doing it would be drowned in the torrent. I would go on my way looking for
the idea where I would be finally hailed as a "genius".

I've also been getting involved with [Neovim][neovim], the project that hopes to
refactor Vim and bring it into the 21st century.

These are just two opportunities that I never would have seized a couple of
years ago.

## Conclusion

I completely understand the inert fear and discomfort that comes when thinking
about "putting yourself out there". It is completely natural and normal. But I
also understand what it takes to break free from that myth and that fear.

I certainly don't think that everyone has to "put themselves out there". But I
do think that if you do seek it out and challenge yourself to, that you will
have meaningful experiences.

Don't let the myth hold you back. Follow the words of Michael Scott:
