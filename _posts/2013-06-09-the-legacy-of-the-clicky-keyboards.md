title: The Legacy of the Clicky Keyboards
description: How I started to love clicky keyboards and ended up buying one of my own.

{{ page.title }}
================

Last year I did a co-op at a company in Minneapolis called [Digi
International][digi]. During the summer there were 11 Software Engineers all
working in one big cubicle that we dubbed "The Supercube." One of the most
defining characteristics of this cubicle was the noise of all of us typing away
as we coded up various projects.

Keyboards are interesting because they are the interface between humans and
computers when it comes to code. Nothing gets into a program source unless it
comes through the keyboard. As a result, a keyboard can be incredibly important
for programmers.

There are all types of keyboards. There are some that focus on ergonomics to
prevent [repetitive strain injury][rsi], some that focus on durability such as
mechanical keyboards, and many more.

## The Start of a Legacy

Most of us just used the standard keyboards we were given but four of the
interns had "clicky keyboards". Clicky keyboards are named (obviously)
for the sound they make when one types on them.

Each of the clicky keyboards was different. The most impressive was a completely
working [IBM Model M][modelm] which was named "The Kremlin" by my Russian
friend. It was the first time I had heard about the keyboard but I understood
the love for it the instant I tried typing on it.

Another one of my coworkers had a [Das Keyboard][das] which is by far the most
intimidating of the keyboards. Some models of the Das Keyboards come
without lettering on the keys.

The third type of clicky keyboard that was used was a [Razer Blackwidow
Ultimate][razer]. It was by far the most visually pleasing of the keyboards.

## The Legacy Continues

I had wanted to buy one while I was there, but I just couldn't justify spending
the money for one. Instead I promised myself that one day I would get a nice
clicky keyboard that would last awhile.

Although I didn't return to Digi this summer, I decided a few weeks into my
current internship to make the investment and buy a clicky keyboard. I did a
bit of research and asked some friends that I knew and I decided on getting a
Das Keyboard. I am a pretty good touch typist so I went with the [Model S
Ultimate][models].

## The Review

I have only had it a few days but I really, *really* enjoy typing on it. It's
very easy to tell that the Cherry MX Blue switches are of top notch quality.
They are very responsive and seem to be incredibly durable.

The keys sound completely awesome while typing on them as well. My girlfriend
isn't the biggest fan of how loud it is over Google Hangouts and I have a
feeling my co-worker that I share an office with isn't going to enjoy it either,
haha.

## Conclusion

So far I'm very happy that I bought a nice keyboard that will last for a long
time. I am also very glad I went with a Das keyboard.

The fellow interns that I worked with last summer have carried the legacy to
various companies. The intern with the Model M will be starting at Microsoft on
July 1st. The intern that had the Das Keyboard is starting a career at Google
soon. I'm at Amazon and there's no telling where the other very smart interns
will end up as they have yet to graduate.

It'll be interesting to see where all of the interns from last summer end up and
where they will take their clicky keyboards next. The legacy will indeed carry
on.
