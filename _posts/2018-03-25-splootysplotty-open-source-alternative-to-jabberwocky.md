    A trend in the open source community is to use cute naming of well known
    concepts for a project. This is a satire of that based on Lewis Carroll's
    famous work.

## {{page.title}}

Welcome to my fantastic open source project named Splootysplotty. It is easier
now than ever to Sploot the Splott.

It is an open source improvement on the legacy software of [Jabberwocky
1.0][jabberwocky] written long ago. It is comparable to any of these projects:
Dalo, Jotts, or Lablem.

I'm very excited for you to use Splootysplotty. Below is my guide on the
problem it solves as well as the why and how to use it.

Splootysplotty has a few core concepts and ideas that you need to understand. I
decided to take these common concepts and instead give them new names to make it
easier to understand my fantastic open source project.

You'll have to memorize what these terms are but that's okay because they are
related to the theme of Splootysplotty and it makes it so much more fun. I'm
sure you will appreciate it when you start to learn this fantastic open source
project.

### Let's Have a Talk, Open Source

But for real, if you create a new project just name things what they are.

We already know what a dependency is. We know what a template is. We know what a
function is. We know what things are, so just name them accordingly.

Choosing names that obscure the concepts and constructs just increases the
barrier to entry of understanding a project.

Coding is the easier part of technology but working with people and
communicating is the hard part. Let’s not make it worse by using *Jabberwocky
Terminology*.

### Wall of Shame

Let's collect various examples of this in current open source projects.
