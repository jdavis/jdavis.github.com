================

Recently I've been going on an [Elon Musk][elon] video watching spree as you can see by
my [recent playlist][playlist] on YouTube.

Elon Musk, without a doubt, is the man I look up to most at the moment. With the
exception of [Steve Wozniak][woz], most of the other people that I really admire
have all passed away. This includes people like [Richard Feynman][feynman], [Carl Sagan][sagan],
[Benjamin Franklin][franklin], and [Steve Jobs][jobs].

One of the [interview videos][video] that I watched recently was a clip of Elon
at the 2013 SXSW. He was asked the following question:

> What's the biggest mistake you've ever made and how did you move
> forward? Looking back, was it really that big of a deal?

I've linked to the point in the interview that it happens. If you have the time,
I'd definitely recommend watching the whole thing. It's an excellent interview,
like always.

I figured he would mention something about building a business or possibly a
financial situation, but he didn't. It was actually straight from Elon's heart
which is why I really enjoyed it.

It took him awhile to come up with an answer for it but here is what he
answered:

> The biggest mistake, in general, that I've made and I'm trying to correct for
> that is to put too much of a weighting on somebody's talent and not enough on
> their personality... It actually matters whether someone has a good heart, it
> really does. I've made the mistake of thinking sometimes it's just about the
> brain.

The reason why I love this quote so much is that it completely embodies the way
I approach the world. I have always argued that if one cares enough and works
hard enough, they will **always** outperform someone that somewhat cares and is
only riding on their natural ability.

This whole idea, I think, is best shown in the movie [Gattaca][gattaca]. It is
without a doubt my favorite movie. If you haven't Googled it by now, my favorite
tag line: "I never save anything for the swim back" is from Gattaca.

The next post that I will write in the next week or so will talk about why I
love Gattaca so much. It is a long overdue post but I think it'll be a good one.
Stay tuned.
