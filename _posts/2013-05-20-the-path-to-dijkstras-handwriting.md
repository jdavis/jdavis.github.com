title: The Path to Dijkstra's Handwriting

{{ page.title }}
================

My handwriting used to be terrible. I think I got to a point in fourth grade
where it just stopped getting better unlike most people. It didn't bother me
either. It was still semi-legible to others and perfectly readable to myself.

My letters lacked consistency. Things weren't spaced very well and it just
looked *messy*. I have no idea how my professors put up with it.

## Inspiration

I've mentioned why I've admired Dijkstra [before][before], but I've read some of his EWDs
and really liked his handwriting. Here's a sample of what his handwriting looked
like. This was taken from his EWD called [On the Cruelty of Really Teaching
Computing Science][ewd]:

The first thing that I noticed when I saw it was just how simple and neat it is.
I'm not calligrapher by any means, but the letters just fit together well and
flow nicely.

I came across a [comment on Reddit][comment] by someone that had Dijkstra as a professor.
Here's what it said:

Dijkstra seemed like a really caring professor. When I read this comment, I put
it in the back of my head in case I ever wanted to improve my handwriting.
It wasn't until the summer of 2011 that I decided to spend some time to refine
my handwriting so that it looked similar to Dijkstra's.

## The Process

The first thing that I wanted to do was just develop the muscles around my hand
that helped with consistency and spacing. I did some Googling and came across [a
site][handwriting] that had a few exercises.


<div class="gallery one">

<a href="/img/handwriting/slashes.gif"><img src="/img/handwriting/slashes.gif"></a>

</div>

The basic idea is to repeat the exercises over and over until the marks start to
look really, really good. I went through pages and pages in a notebook repeating
the exercises until my hand was numb. Whenever I had some free time, I'd just
take out the notebook and continue practicing. Eventually my lines and loops got
very consistent.

Next I found an image of the complete alphabet in Dijkstra's handwriting by
someone who turned his handwriting into [a font][font]. I printed it off and
then used that to base my handwriting off of.

</a>

</div>

The next step was to write out the alphabet over and over again for a similar
reason as the above exercises. If you do it long enough, eventually your letters
will become more consistent over time and look a lot nicer.

Once again, I used up a ton of paper for this and did it whenever I wasn't busy.
Here are a couple pictures of a scrap of paper I was able to find.

</a>

<a href="/img/handwriting/progress2.png">
<img src="/img/handwriting/progress2.png">
<span>Practice with lower and upper case</span>
</a>

</div>

Obviously it isn't perfect and I never want it to be. I only wanted to use it as
a base and customize it from there. I tried to incorporate a few of my own
differences over time.

## The Result

After three months and a few notebooks later, I had a pretty nice and new handwriting. Curiously
enough, it looked like a hybrid between my mom's handwriting and Dijkstra's.

</div>

The thing that I learned is that often someone's handwriting isn't exactly
"bad", usually the person just doesn't take the time to slow down and write
things nicely. There are still sometimes when my handwriting becomes a bit
sloppy during times when I'm trying to write quickly like taking notes or taking
a test. It is pretty inevitable. As long as I'm not in a rush I'm always able to
write the way I learned to.
