title: Where Do I Sign Up to Change the World?
description: If there's only one thing I'm certain about in my life, it's that I want to leave this world having made it a better place than when I came into it.

================

The title of this post was inspired by an idea that came to my head in the last
month or so about my future. I will be graduating from university in this
upcoming May of next year after taking 3 semesters off because of
internships/co-ops. I'm at the point where I need to start to make decisions
about my future.

The only thing that I'm certain of at this point is that I want to leave this
world having made it a better place than when I came into it.

You might think that it sounds incredibly cheesy, but I agree. Though the thing that
I've come to realize over the last year was described the best by
[Google's][google] current CEO, [Larry Page][page], during this year's Google
IO. Here's the clip:

</div>

I cut out the quote just in case you don't want to watch the video:

> Despite the faster change we have in the industry. We are still moving slow
> relative to the opportunities that we have. And some of that, I think, is due
> to the **negativity** ... We should be building great things that don't exist,
> right?

Although he's just talking about the media and its negativism, I can't help but
feel the same sentiment. I would much rather be hopelessly optimistic than
cynically pessimistic.

## So, where do I sign up?

I've come across another quote that is just a question that perfectly sums up
how I am feeling as I wonder about what I want to do after I graduate. This time
the quote is from [Elon Musk][musk]. If you don't know who Elon Musk is, you
need to find out now. Go to [YouTube][yt] and find some of his interviews. I've
said it before, but I have a feeling that a hundred years from now, he will be
considered a modern prophet.

The quote is from his [TED Talk][ted] that he gave. He was asked what caused him
to start an all-electric car company. Here's what he said:

>  Well, it goes back to when I was in university. I thought about, what are the
>  problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future
>  of humanity?

This was really profound when I heard him say this. I think it's really rare to
hear about a person that starts a business to change the world. I feel that too
often we hear about people starting a business to make money, or to gain fame,
or to gain power. While it certainly isn't true for all businesses, I feel that
it is true for more than what it should be.

## Conclusion

As I come upon these major life decisions in the next six months, I can only
try my best to keep these two things in mind:

1. **I want to build things that don't exist.**
2. **I want to work on problems that are most likely to affect the future of the
   world and humanity.**

I still don't know yet where I need to go to sign up on this list. All I know is
that I'm searching for it. I'm just being hopelessly optimistic that my
preparation and an opportunity will come along to make some luck.
