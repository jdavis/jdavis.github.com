title: An Email from Edsger Dijkstra's Son
description:
    Marcus Dijkstra came across my blog post on how I improved my handwriting
    and used Edsger's as inspiration. He sent me an email with more details
    about how Edsger maintained his script.

================

Over four years ago I wrote about how I learned to [write like
Dijkstra][handwriting]. Since then it has become one of my most visited blog
posts.

The last person I ever expected to read it though was one of Dijkstra's family
members.

In January 2016, I received an email from Marcus Dijkstra, Edsger's son. It was
a surreal moment and an one of my favorite emails to date.

I want to share it with everyone because of extra details it has about how
Dijkstra improved upon his handwriting.

## The Email

> self-disciplined enough to keep paying attention) does contribute to the

> He spend quite some time finding the right spacing, and experimented with
> double lines, so as to have a top and bottom for the aceimnorsuvwxz letters,
> as well as length indicators for bdhklf and gjpqy sticks. In the end this was
> discarded in favour of a fairly wide spaced lined one.
>
> The script itself was carefully designed (and subsequently trained on, always
> carefully drawing the individual letters one by one, albeit faster in time) to
> avoid ambiguity like between x and multiplication, one and the letter l, seven
> and one, zero and the letter o etc. after he found sometimes not being sure
> about what he actually wrote the day before and seeing students ending up in
> real messes.
>
> From the party trick department: After having trouble with his right wrist
> (arm?) caused by too many hours of writing he decided to learn to do it left
> handed too. After a few months he could, and kept writing left handed
> alternate days, also after his right arm was back in business.
>
> Enjoy your script,

> Marcus
