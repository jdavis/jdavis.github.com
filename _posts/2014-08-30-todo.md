# {{ page.title }}

[Cal Ripken Jr.][cal-wiki] is a Hall of Fame shortstop/third baseman that played
from 1981 -- 2001 all on the [Baltimore Orioles][cal-orioles].

He is well known for his incredible streak of never missing a game for 17 years
starting in 1982 until he voluntarily ended it in 1998.

There have been a lot of great baseball players through the ages but one thing
that really struck me when reading about Cal Ripken is how he approached
fielding.
