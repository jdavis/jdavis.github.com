Cal Ripken Jr. wasn't actually a Software Engineering. He was a game changing
shortstop in Major League Baseball.

## Cal Ripken Jr.

[Cal Ripken Jr.][cal-wiki] is a Hall of Fame shortstop/third baseman that played
from 1981 -- 2001 for the [Baltimore Orioles][cal-orioles].

He is well known for his incredible streak of never missing a game for 17 years
starting in 1982 until he voluntarily ended it in 1998.

There have been a lot of great baseball players through the ages but one thing
that really struck me when reading about Cal Ripken was how he approached
fielding.

## An Early Look at Cal

<div class="figure right">
    <a href="/img/ripken/scouting.jpg" rel="lightbox[bio]" title="Cal Ripken Jr Scouting Report">
        <img src="/img/ripken/scouting.jpg" width="180">
        <span>High school scouting report</span>
    </a>
</div>

When Ripken was in high school, his scouting report (pictured) mentions his
abilities and talents. At the time, Ripken was a pitcher that could play
shortstop as well. Ripken was noted for being a "outstanding competitor" that
"can hit".

His weaknesses on the other hand are far more interesting given his career as we
know it. He was 6 foot 3 inches and 195lbs at the time (he later ended up being
6 feet 4 inches and 225lbs for his career). His weaknesses included only a 4.6
second run to first base and "growing taller faster than mobility can allow."

Lastly and probably the most interesting was how the report finished. It stated
that Ripken "plays [shortstop] but lack of fluid mobility will limit prospect
here."

Ripken went on to be considered one of the best shortstops/third basemen in the
history of baseball. TODO

### The Streak

Below is a table listing the years during the streak and the number of games
played during them as taken from [Baseball Reference][streak-baseball-ref].

The years of 1994 and 1995 are special because of the [MLB
Strike][streak-strike] which caused many games to be cancelled across the league
in which many teams had their seasons cut short.

An amazing fact brought up by a user on [reddit's /r/baseball][streak-reddit],
is that if a player started playing during the 1998 season and didn't miss a
game since then, they would only now (around this season or so) be reaching the
2,632 mark that Ripken set.

Disregarding double headers, at 17 years that equals 6,209.25 days which means
he was playing a MLB game 42.4% of the days during that time. I find that a
pretty incredible statistic considering how physically intense it can be.

## Style of Play

Ripken was a departure from the standard for shortstops at the time. He changed
the game as far as playing shortstop goes and influenced many other larger
shortstops such as Derek Jeter and Miguel Tejada (source). He was taller and
bigger than the others. Yet he was able to outperform everyone else by realizing
his limits and compensating for them.

### Mind Over Batter

As Rosenfeld mentions in his book about Ripken that he would study batters in
order to better understand their hitting patterns. By understanding which
batters hit where, it improved his ability to determine the best place for him
to stand.

In addition to that, he'd study the pitchers on his team so he could figure out
how pitchers acted in certain situations. This is important because different
types of pitches can affect how and when the batter makes contact with the ball.
This means that there are times when ground balls are more often or pop flys.

Considering baseball is all about repeated successes outnumbering failures due
to the number of games and plays that happen each game, Ripken didn't have to be
right every single time; he only had to be right more than most other
shortstops.

### Fundamentals are Key

Ripken wasn't known for his flashy plays and wasn't a regular in the highlight
reel.

Instead, Ripken focused on practicing and perfecting the fundamentals of being a
fielder. It wasn't about amazing sliding stops and jumping throws. He preferred
to be in the right place and position his body infront of the ball like they
tell you in baseball practice.

Even Derek Jeter noted his repetitive practice and drills:

> [Cal Ripken Jr] went out to his shortstop position and began fielding ground
> ball after ground ball either off a hitter's swing or a coach's fungo.
>
> Jeter turned to another person in the dugout and said, "So that's how you get
> to be Cal Ripken."

Note about fielding statistics here.

Cal Ripken Jr. even has written a book about how to ["Play Baseball the Ripken
Way."][cal-book].

## If Ripken Studied Computer Science...

What meaningful parallels can we gather from the legacy of Cal Ripken Jr. if we
apply it to a completely different occupation?


1. Know the fundamentals *very well*.
2. Don't miss a game.
3. Compensate for your shortcomings.

The way Ripken approached playing baseball is really interesting to me. During
school studying Computer Science and now being a Software Engineer, I have long
believed that understanding the fundamentals of Computer Science and proper
software development practices will TODO.

### Understand the Fundamentals

Computer Science fundamentals include the following:

- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Computational complexity
- Understanding programming languages
    - Different categories of programming languages
    - Type systems
- Operating systems

Software Engineering fundamentals include the following:

- Design patterns
- Software design
- Fault tolerant systems
- Testing
