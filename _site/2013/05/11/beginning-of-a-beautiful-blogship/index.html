<h1>The Beginning of a Beautiful Blogship</h1>

<p>I have been a fan of <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanmarz">Nathan Marz</a> ever since I came across his blog post
on his <a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/my-experience-as-the-first-employee-of-a-y-combinator-startu.html">experience working at a startup</a>. I was pretty young at the
time (my first summer after starting university in 2010) and was pretty influenced by
what he said. Just this past month I saw a new post by him on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a>.
The post was about <a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/break-into-silicon-valley-with-a-blog-1.html">creating opportunities in Silicon Valley with a
blog</a>. I've always considered creating a place for me to post some
writings/musings that I have, but that post really persuaded me. I also came
across an <a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html">older post</a> of his that also has the same convincing
argument.</p>

<h2>Isolationism</h2>

<p>Ever since I started using the internet way back in elementary school, I've
always been rather hesitant to reveal my identity to online communities. I'd
never use the same username across websites. I filtered everything I said to
remove any personal references.</p>

<p>I was late to get a Facebook profile because I didn't see the value in it. I
didn't get a Twitter account for years even though I had known about it for
ages. I even went through a period of roughly 1.5 years where I deactivated my
Facebook account to focus on school and save time.  It wasn't until about last
year that I realized this was just harming myself and decided to reverse it.</p>

<h2>Creating an Identity</h2>

<p>The first thing I did was to start to update my GitHub profile. I reasoned that
having an active GitHub would be the most beneficial. I updated my profile
picture and email, updated my dotfiles, created a few more repositories, and
started following more people.</p>

<p>Next I bought a domain for myself and started to set up a personal web page. I
started to link all of my profiles together. I started with GitHub but
eventually started adding other profiles like Goodreads, Strava, Facebook, and
so on.</p>

<p>In January, I decided to dedicate more time to using Twitter. I started tweeting
regularly and started following some of the people pretty involved in the
programming community. I quickly realized that Twitter was a great source for
new and emerging technology as well as just general news.</p>

<p>After Twitter, a few more social sites followed. I created a Google+ profile
even though the majority of my friends use Facebook. I also set up a LinkedIn
profile which was arguably the most important social network that I wasn't a
part of.</p>

<p>To see all of my profiles, check out my <a href="/about/">About</a> page.</p>

<h2>Writings</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a> is possibly one of my favorite Computer Scientists.
His work has been completely pervasive in the field and has influenced many
things. One of his most cherished habits was in creating amazing articles,
called EWDs (for his initials), written in a fountain pen on a subject that
interested him. He decided to start doing this because he suffered from writer's
block for over a year and discovered that if he writes just for himself, his
writing just flowed.  The University of Texas has since published over 1300 EWDs
in an <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">online archive</a>.</p>

<p>I've thought about Dijkstra a lot. I really liked his idea of writing just for
himself. I've kept numerous journals over the past few years and that's always
what motivated me to continue writing in them. I've just never had the
motivation to share those writings with others.</p>

<p>I plan on changing all of that by making blogging a habit. My blog is probably
going to <a href="http://vimeo.com/24715531">suck at first</a> but hopefully in a few years my ability will be
quite refined. I'm going to set a strict minimum of two posts a month. I plan on
exploring some things that interest me and already have a list of topics that I
wish to write about.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I was very clearly wrong in thinking that social networks were a waste of time.
I was also very wrong in thinking that if I just focused on my studies, I could
still create opportunities for myself. I'm just glad I've realized this before I
graduate from college next year.</p>

<p>I'd encourage everyone to start making an online presence as soon as possible
even if you aren't in the tech industry. If you are in the tech industry, there
is nothing better that you can do with your time than invest in creating a
blog/website. Like Nathan says, the return on investment is one of the highest
things you can do.</p>
